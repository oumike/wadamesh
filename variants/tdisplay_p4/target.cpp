// esp_restart() on the ESP32-P4 is SW_CPU_RESET: esp_system_reset_modules_on_exit()
// (esp_system/port/soc/esp32p4/system_internal.c) resets the DMA engines, UARTs, SDMMC and crypto,
// but not the MIPI-DSI host or its DPI path. The display driver then initialises over a host still
// half-configured from the session that restarted, and the panel stays dark. A power cycle or the
// reset button is a full chip reset and always recovers it -- which is exactly what users saw: a
// setting that reboots came up with the screen off, and the NEXT reboot by hand was fine.
// (Same defect, same fix as camillia-mt's T-Display P4 port.)
//
// So a software restart becomes that full reset: the RTC watchdog's system reset, which resets the
// CPU and all peripherals and spares only the RTC domain. Done as a shutdown handler so it covers
// every restart path (rebootDevice, OTA, console, factory reset) without touching any of them.
//
// esp_restart() runs shutdown handlers newest first and this one never returns, so it is installed
// before anything else registers one (Wi-Fi's among them) to run LAST, after the others have done
// their work. RTC memory survives the system reset, which is how the next boot knows its watchdog
// reset was a deliberate restart rather than a hang.
