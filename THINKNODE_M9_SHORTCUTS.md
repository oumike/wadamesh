# ThinkNode M9: Keyboard & D-pad Guide

The Elecrow ThinkNode M9 has **no touchscreen** — every screen, every setting,
and every chat is driven by the d-pad, the dedicated function keys, and the
QWERTY keyboard. If you're coming from the T-Deck or Heltec V4 (touch-first),
this page is the five-minute tour that makes the board feel native.

## The inputs

- **D-pad** — four arrows around a centre button (**OK**). Arrows move the
  on-screen focus highlight; OK activates whatever is focused. **Holding OK**
  is the board's long-press: it fires the held item's long-press action (a
  chat message's context menu, the SD row's hold-to-format) and unlocks the
  lock screen.
- **Function row** — dedicated keys for Chats, Home, Mentions, Advert, Map,
  Back, Mic and Ctrl (see the table below).
- **QWERTY keyboard** — the keyboard controller resolves Shift/symbol layers
  itself, so keys always deliver their final character. It latches one key at
  a time, which is why there are no chords on this board — long-press carries
  the second layer instead. Start typing in a chat and the composer focuses
  itself; any key wakes the screen from idle.

## The one rule: Back closes what you see, then goes back

**Back** always closes the *top* layer, one per press: map pan mode → an open
dropdown → the power menu → the Control Center → a full-screen app → a dialog
→ any popup → an open chat. Nothing ever closes invisibly beneath something
else.

Once there is nothing left covering the screen, **Back returns you to the
previous screen** — the tab you came from, however you got there: a function
key, an app-drawer tile, "Show on map", a contact's Send-msg button. Keep
pressing and you keep walking back through where you have been. When the trail
runs out Back lands on Home, and on Home with nothing open it does nothing,
because that is the root.

**HOME** is the shortcut past all of that: it goes straight to the root and
clears the trail, so Back from there won't jump you back out again.

The only exception is deliberate: progress overlays (SD format, bulk delete)
block all keys until the operation finishes — Back will not navigate out from
under a running operation.

## Function keys

| Key | Press | Hold |
|---|---|---|
| **MSG** | Jump to the Chats tab; inside a conversation, return to the chat list (closes an open app first) | — |
| **HOME** | Peel one layer off an open app; on the Home tab, toggle the app drawer; otherwise jump Home (and clear the Back trail) | — |
| **@ (Mentions)** | Open the Mentions screen | — |
| **ADV** | Open the Send Advert page | **Toggle GPS on/off** |
| **MAP** | Jump to the Map tab — press again *on* the map to toggle pan mode | — |
| **BACK** | Close the top layer (see above) | — |
| **CTRL** | Open the Control Center (quick toggles, incl. the keyboard light: off / on / auto) | — |
| **MIC** | Nothing yet — deliberately reserved | — |
| **OK / Enter** | Activate the focused item; send a message; run a terminal command; newline in the editor | **Long-press the focused item / unlock the lock screen** |

The **MSG**, **HOME**, **@**, **ADV**, **MAP**, and **CTRL** shortcuts remain
active while typing or using a picker. Back, the d-pad, and OK remain contextual
so they can leave edit mode, move the caret or selection, and activate controls.

## Map pan mode

On the Map tab, press **MAP** again: the arrows now pan the map instead of
moving focus. **MAP** or **BACK** exits. Pan mode switches itself off whenever
you leave the map or anything opens over it, so a stale pan can never eat a
key press later. Auto-follow pauses while you pan and resumes when you exit.
Entering the map fresh always starts in normal navigation.

## Typing & editing

Inside a text field the left/right arrows move the caret — and when the caret
is already at the edge of the text, the same press steps focus *out* of the
field, so you're never stuck. Enter sends (toggleable under Settings), Back
leaves the field. In the Terminal, Enter runs the command; in the text editor
it inserts a newline.

While a chat message is focused and newer messages are below it, a down arrow
appears at the right edge. Press **Right** to select it, then **OK** to jump to
the newest message.

Channels, direct messages, and room conversations place **#** and emoji to the
right of the message input. Press Right to move from the input to **#**, and
Right again to move to emoji. Press **OK** on either button to open its picker.

In the symbol grid, use all four arrows to move the highlight and **OK** to
insert the selected character.

The Create/Join channel forms use the same **#** action beside every text
field. Right moves from the field to **#**; Left returns to editing the field.
Password fields use the same control, including Wi-Fi, MQTT, and repeater login.
After inserting a symbol, focus returns to the originating text field.

## Lock screen

**Hold OK** to unlock — the keyboard's hardware long-press stands in for the
hold-to-unlock other boards do by touch. With "Flash on new message" enabled,
an incoming message wakes (or lock-reveals) the screen and pulses the keyboard
backlight.

## Inside apps

Store apps (Snake and friends) get the d-pad natively: arrows steer, OK taps
the centre — start, steer, and tap-to-retry all work. Display-only apps
(Airtime, RF Monitor) keep normal navigation: arrows move between the app's
own buttons or scroll the feed. **Back and Home always escape an app** — no
app can trap the keys, even while the screen is locked.

## Recent improvements (beta_66 branch)

If you last used the M9 on an earlier beta, the notable navigation changes:

- **Back now actually goes back** — once everything covering the screen was
  closed, Back had nothing left to do and the press simply died on any bare
  tab. It now walks back through the screens you visited, then Home. Jumps that
  used to strand you ("Show on map" from Discover or Contacts, a route replay
  from a chat, the Home unread line, the ✉ badge, app-drawer tiles) all return
  properly. **Back also works in the first-boot wizard** now, stepping back
  through its screens like the on-screen Back button.
- **Back restored and made consistent** — it had regressed to doing nothing
  outside text fields, and could close hidden popups beneath the Control
  Center. Both fixed; the close-what-you-see rule above now holds everywhere.
- **The map opens faster the first time** — the cold open was doing a
  whole-card zoom scan whose result was thrown away, and (with no GPS fix) was
  repeating that scan on *every* open. The "Loading map…" hint now appears
  immediately instead of after the scan, so the board no longer looks frozen on
  the previous screen while the first tiles decode.
- **The d-pad no longer goes dead for a second** when a message arrives, and
  the Spectrum page no longer steers an invisible cursor around the app drawer
  underneath it.
- **Apps can't strand you** — opening Advert/Mentions over a running app used
  to orphan it with no key path back; app permission dialogs are now
  answerable with the d-pad.
- **Map pan cleans up after itself** (see above — it used to leak across tab
  jumps).
- **Keyboard light "On" applies at boot**, not after the first dim cycle.
- **Terminal chat shows incoming replies**, not just your own sent lines.
- **GPS works from a cold boot** — the toggle (and ADV-hold) no longer depends
  on a boot-time detection race.
- **Spectrum analyzer** sweeps roughly twice as fast, survives read glitches
  without flattening the trace, and waits for an in-flight transmission
  instead of cutting it off when opened mid-send.
