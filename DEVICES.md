# Supported devices

Current hardware support, install paths and maturity. "Stable" means the board
ships on the stable release channel; "Beta" means it is new and lives on the
test channel until the next stable promote. Install links:
[flasher.wadamesh.com](https://flasher.wadamesh.com) (browser, Chrome/Edge over
USB) and the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/ALLFATHER-BV/wadamesh/releases).

## Feature notes per board

- **T-Deck**: the everything device: touch, physical keyboard, trackball cursor
  or d-pad navigation, microSD (deep 5000-message chat history, map tile packs,
  data storage), GPS on the Plus, notification sounds through the I2S speaker.
- **Heltec V4 + TFT**: touch UI with the on-screen keyboard; the optional
  Expansion Kit adds environment sensors (home-screen chart) and a piezo
  buzzer. V4.3 boards get the switchable high-gain receive LNA toggle.
- **Tanmatsu**: keyboard-driven UI (no touchscreen) with the coloured function
  keys mapped to tabs, ALT accent picker, UI scaling (Normal/Large/Huge),
  microSD for all persistent data. Ships through the Tanmatsu launcher store,
  updates arrive as store updates.
- **ThinkNode M9**: keyboard plus d-pad navigation (no touch), same feature set
  as the other boards where the hardware allows. Shares the T-LoRa Pager's
  no-touch keyboard shortcuts — M/C/H/A/S jump to the five main tabs, Q/E nudge
  a focused slider, W/A/X/D pan the Map tab, Backspace jumps to the first
  unread message in a chat — alongside its own dedicated Message/Home/Map/Back
  keys; see [TLORA_PAGER_SHORTCUTS.md](TLORA_PAGER_SHORTCUTS.md) for what each
  one does. New in beta_38; expect rough edges and report them.
- **RAK WisMesh Tap V2**: newest port, touch-driven. The browser-flash path is
  fresh; if the flasher cannot open the serial port, put the board in download
  mode manually and retry, and please report it.

## Requested boards

Open hardware requests, roughly in demand order. Ports are welcome, see
